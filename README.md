# PRODIGY_CS_02

Developing a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. Performing operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images.

Note: Image encryption and decryption results in the loss of data. Thus, the input image and the decrypted image may not look same.
